```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
#inserted code chunk under Code / Insert Chunk
#opt-cmd-I is the hotkey
y<-2+1
y
```
# Text to explain the code
Beyond the code chunks, I wil use these 3 types of information in text: 
1. explain the biology behind the code
2. explain the logic behind the code
3. I cannot think of a third one right now
